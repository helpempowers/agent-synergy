**"Plug-and-play AI agents that work like employees‚Äîreliable, scalable, and tailored for mid-market efficiency."**

---

## üéØ **Mission & Vision**

- **Mission**: Empower mid-market companies (50‚Äì500 employees) to replace repetitive tasks with AI agents that are easy to deploy, seamlessly integrated, and deliver measurable ROI.
- **Vision**: Become the **go-to platform for AI-driven workforce augmentation**, transforming how mid-market businesses operate by 2030.

---

## üß© **Problem**

Mid-market companies face operational and financial challenges:

1. **Repetitive Work Overload**: Tasks like QA testing, customer support, reporting, and administrative work consume 20‚Äì30% of staff time, reducing focus on high-value tasks.
2. **High Costs**: Hiring for low-end roles costs $50K‚Äì$80K per employee annually (salary, benefits, training), with high turnover rates (15‚Äì20% in mid-market).
3. **Tool Fragmentation**: Disparate tools (e.g., Zendesk, Jira, Excel) lack integration, creating manual overhead and errors.
4. **Scaling Constraints**: Enterprise RPA solutions (e.g., UiPath, Automation Anywhere) are too expensive ($100K+ annually) and complex (6‚Äì12 months to implement), while standalone AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) require technical expertise.

**Current Solutions Fall Short**:
- **Zapier/Workato**: Limited to app integrations, no autonomous decision-making.
- **Enterprise RPA**: Costly, rigid, and overkill for mid-market.
- **OpenAI Assistants**: Developer-centric, lacking pre-built workflows or enterprise features.
- **Moveworks**: Enterprise-focused, unaffordable for mid-market ($50K‚Äì$100K/year).

**Market Gap**: No affordable, reliable, and turnkey AI agent platform exists for mid-market businesses to automate repetitive tasks with measurable ROI.
